        <p>Changed......</p>
        <p>CtrlP Extension that allows adding custom menus of commands</p>
        <p>We usually have a bunch of useful commands, but don't want to create a
            mapping for each of them.. Instead of a host of key mappings and commands
            and remembering them all, wouldn't it be more useful to have a single
            mapping/command for all the other commands?</p>
        <p>Vim-Ctrp-Menu is a CtrlP extention that attempts to solve this problem
            by allowing you to create your own custom menu of commands. You can
            create as many menus as you like and you get all the goodness that
            Ctrp provides like fuzzy matching.</p>

                alt="ctrlp-menu" /></p>
        <h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2>
        <p>You need to have <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">CtrlP</a>            installed before you can use this plugin</p>
        <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
        <h3 id="usingpathogen">Using Pathogen</h3>
        <pre><code>cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/nmanandhar/vim-ctrlp-menu.git 
</code></pre>
        <h2 id="definingmenus">Defining Menus</h2>
        <p>This plugin uses the variable <code>g:ctrlp_menus</code> to define the
            menu. This variable should be initialized in your vimrc to be a dictionary
            of menus
        </p>
        <p>Structure of g:ctrp<em>menu</em>menus</p>
        <pre><code>let g:ctrlp_menus= {
            \    "myMenuGroup1": {
            \        "command1 for myMenuGroup1": 'echom "command1 of myMenuGroup1 executed"',
            \        "command2 for myMenuGroup1": 'echom "command2 of myMenuGroup1 executed"'
            \    },
            \    "myMenuGroup2": {
            \        "command1 for myMenuGroup2": 'echom "command1 of myMenuGroup2 executed"',
            \        "command2 for myMenuGroup2": 'echom "command2 of myMenuGroup2 executed"'
            \    }
            \}
</code></pre>
        <p>Alternately, you can defined the same thing using a different syntax</p>
        <pre><code>let g:ctrlp_menus={}

let g:ctrlp_menus.myMenuGroup1=
            \{
            \   "command1 for myMenuGroup1": 'echom "command1 of myMenuGroup1 executed"',
            \   "command2 for myMenuGroup1": 'echom "command2 of myMenuGroup1 executed"'
            \}

let g:ctrlp_menus.myMenuGroup1={
            \   "command1 for myMenuGroup2": 'echom "command1 of myMenuGroup2 executed"',
            \   "command2 for myMenuGroup2": 'echom "command2 of myMenuGroup2 executed"'
            \}
</code></pre>
        <p>Personally I prefer the second syntax because each menu group is defined
            separately.Note if your menu group has a space in between, you will
            have to use the bracket notation
        </p>
        <pre><code>let g:ctrlp_menus["my menu group one "]={ ...
</code></pre>
        <p>Once the menu is defined and sourced, you can use CtrlpMenu command. By
            default this command will combine all the commands and show them in
            CtrlP. If you pass in the menu group, it will show only commands in
            that group.</p>
        <p>Note in CommandMode, you also get completion of the MenuName. Press CtrlpMenu
            followed by space followed by tab to get completion of menu names</p>
        <h3 id="disablingthedefaultmenu">Disabling the default menu</h3>
        <p>This plugin adds a default menu called default_menu. To disable this simply
            put the following in your vimrc</p>
        <pre><code>let g:ctrlp_use_default_menu = 0
</code></pre>
        <h3 id="mappings">Mappings</h3>
        <p>By default, no mappings are provided. However it is recommened that you
            have a mapping to open up the menus, since it is faily tedious to type
            CtrlpMenu on the command line</p>
        <p>You can put something like the following in your vimrc file</p>
        <pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;m :CtrlpMenu&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>Since no menu group was passed, it will show all the commands in your menues.</p>
        <p>Another possibility would be to use abbreviation in command mode to shorten
            the command</p>
        <pre><code>cabbrev menu CtrlpMenu
</code></pre>
